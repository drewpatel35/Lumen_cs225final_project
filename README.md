# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

    We are going to meet at least once a week on Wednesdays at the CIF. Meetings will be around 2-3 hours, where the first 30 minutes or so will be dedicated to going over what work we completed while not with each other and what work we will have to finish for the rest of our meeting. This part will be recorded by one group member in a shared document. At the end of the meeting, we will go over what needs to be completed by the next meeting and who will do what work.

2. **Assistance** 

    If we need help, we have a group chat and phone numbers to contact each other. We expect to get a response within 2 hours. We understand that everyone in our group has other work and committments, so a reply within this timeframe is fair.

3. **Respect** 

    Every team member will hold each other accountable for respect. If we find that one team member is not being respectful towards another, then we will address it in our team meetings as a group. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

    We plan to distrubute work based on what we want to complete by the next meeting. Additionally, we will split work in teams of two, that way if someone falls behind or unforeseen work appears, they have someone else to aid them. Having previously worked together, this method of work distribution has worked the best.  
5. **Time Commitment** 

    Each member will be working on this project around 5-6 hours a week, including the weekly team meetings. This number is subject to change, however, based on workloads of each week. When time committments come up for one member it is not as much of a problem because we decided to split work into teams of two. That way if something comes up with one member, it won't set back an entire aspect of the project. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 

    As stated before, if a conflict arises, we want to resolve it as soon as possible, so we will address it as a team during our weekly team meeting. If a certain member is not doing their work on time and coming to meetings late, then we will make it very clear that there is a problem and it has to come to an end. We find that when the entire group is involved with the issue rather than just one member talking to another, it is much more effective at solving our conflicts.
