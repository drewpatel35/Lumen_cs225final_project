    We are going to meet at least once a week on Wednesdays at the CIF. Meetings will be around 2-3 hours, where the first 30 minutes or so will be dedicated to going over what work we completed while not with each other and what work we will have to finish for the rest of our meeting. This part will be recorded by one group member in a shared document. At the end of the meeting, we will go over what needs to be completed by the next meeting and who will do what work.
