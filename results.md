## The output and correctness of each algorithm
The output and correctness of each algorithm â€“ You should summarize, visualize, or highlight some part of the full-scale run of each algorithm. Additionally, the report should briefly describe what tests you performed to confirm that each algorithm was working as intended.

## The answer to your leading question
Our leading question was to find the shortest travel distance and least connected travel between Chicago and the five best vacation spots. Also a side goal was set to calculate the largest airports based on number of connections.

We did answer this problem by first passing the CSV in to the program and parsing it to store in a graph structure. We have implemented required structs and maps for an adjacency list and indexing helper to enable graph functionality. Furthermore, to search the graph to find the shortest travel distance and least connected travel between Chicago and the five best vacation spots we have implemented BFS and Dijkstra's algorithms.
